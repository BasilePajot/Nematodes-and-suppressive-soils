# Nematodes-and-suppressive-soils
JRLAT collaborative project

# OUR PROJECT

### A brief description
A plant parasitic nematode (PPN) is a microscopic worm that attacks plants. We focus our researches on the PPN Meloidogyne graminicola, which feeds on the roots of rice. The main objective of our subject is to determine how a soil can be suppressive against M. graminicola. We will try to analyse the interactions between M. graminicola, rice plants (IR64), and a bacteria, Pseudomonas corrugata, which has been proven to have a nematicide effect against M. graminicola.
